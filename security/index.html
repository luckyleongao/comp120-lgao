<h1>A Security Assessment of Ride-Hailing Service</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Ride-Hailing Service is a product that could display nearby vehicles for passengers on the map. It mainly includes the following five functions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show the nearby vehicles for a given passenger on the map, and store the ride request from a passenger into a database;</li>
  <li>Update the position infos for a vehicle that is in the database;</li>
  <li>Display a list all passenger records for a given username if records exist in the database;</li>
  <li>Display a list all vehicle records for a given username if records exist in the database;</li>
  <li>Display a list all passenger records if records exist in the database;</li>
</ul>
<p>I am hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the security and privacy issues of the Ride-Hailing Service.</p>

<h2>2. Methodology</h2>
<p>Since we already have the server-vuln.js file, we can use a static application testing (SAST) tool called "nodejsscan" (https://github.com/ajinabraham/NodeJsScan) to find insecure code patterns using simple pattern matcher from "libsast" and syntax-aware semantic code pattern search tool "semgrep".</p>
<p>In addition, we can use curl to test if there exist XSS issues on the server side.</p>
<p>Finally, we want use the tool "snyk" (https://github.com/snyk/snyk) to find the known vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies.</p>

<h2>3. Abstract of Findings</h2>
<p>There exists many vulnerabilities of the Ride-Hailing Service, the most common and severe are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</li>
  <li>SQL injection (SQLi)</li>
  <li>Open-source vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>If an attacker exploits XSS vulnerabilities, they could perform malicious actions like account tampering, data theft, remote control, or even malware distribution.</p>
<p>If an attacker exploits SQLi vulnerabilities, they could pull the list of all tables in the databases and then retrieve any information they want. Even worse, they are able to delete all the information in the database.</p>
<p>If an attacker exploits Open-source vulnerabilities, they can put in malicious code to steal/compromise users data.</p>

An attacker can then cause a program using 
a Regular Expression to enter these extreme 
situations and then hang for a very long time.

<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Adopting good coding practices can secure applications against common JavaScript vulnerabilities on both the client-side and server-side. When using JavaScript, always follow the following key guidelines for enhanced security:</p>
<ul>
      <li>Never trust user input</li>
      <li>Sanitize user input</li>
      <li>Define a content security policy</li>
      <li>Encrypt data transmitted between the client and the server</li>
      <li>Conduct regular scans on your codebase</li>
</ul>
<p>Following these best coding practices is usually the first step for securing your web applications.</p>
<p>Besides, by using security measures provided by package managers ( such as npm ) and security solutions, companies can stay ahead of the vulnerabilities which arise from using these open-source packages.</p>
