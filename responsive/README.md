This repository implements a responsive design which includes:  
If the browser screen width is greater than 1200 pixels, display the top-left image of homer.jpg (i.e., the one that reads "Homer's Night Out")  
If the browser screen width is greater than 1100 pixels but less than or equal to 1200 pixels, display the second image on the first row  
If the browser screen width is greater than 1000 pixels but less than or equal to 1100 pixels, display the first image on the second row (i.e., "Hmm...").  
If the browser screen width is greater than 900 pixels but less than or equal to 1000 pixels, display the second image on the second row.  
If the browser screen width is greater than 800 pixels but less than or equal to 900 pixels, display the first image on the third row.  
If the browser screen width is greater than 700 pixels but less than or equal to 800 pixels, display the second image on the third row.  
If the browser screen width is greater than 600 pixels but less than or equal to 700 pixels, display the first image on the fourth row.  
If the browser screen width is less than or equal to 600 pixels, display the last image, bottom-right (i.e., "The End").

The entire image homer.jpg is 333px x 500px.

The piazza is really helpful for me to solve most of the problems.

I spent approximately 3 hours to complete this lab.
