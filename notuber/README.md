### This lab creates a page that displays a Google Map of vehicles with latitude and longitude from the ride request API: https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/rides. 

* The map shows your geolocation with the default red pin Google uses.
* Make a request to the ride-hailing API, providing your username, latitude and longitude.
* Each vehicle on the map shall be a marker with ths icon: ![car.png](car.png "car.png")
* Upon clicking on your marker on the map, display an information window (a.k.a., infowindow) noting the closest vehicle from where you are including the distance away in miles.
* Render a polyline (any color) that connects "your" marker to the marker of the closest vehicle.
* Upon clicking on a marker for a vehicle, show popup infowindow noting how far away the vehicle is, in miles, from you.

### The piazza is really helpful for me to solve most of the problems.

### I spent approximately 8 hours to complete this lab.
